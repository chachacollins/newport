                Hello! My name is Collins Chacha. I'm a computer science student currently in my second year of university. I’m often asked, “Hey Chacha, what kind of programming do you do?”—and I never quite know how to answer. I do everything: frontend, backend, kernel development, mobile apps, compilers... If it’s programmable, I do it.  
                I genuinely enjoy learning how things work, diving down rabbit holes, and picking up whatever’s needed to build what I’m excited about.  
                I’m also an author, and you can find many of my ramblings on programming topics  
                <a  href="blog.html">here</a>.

            <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
            <p class><strong>C</strong>: I use C for the same reason many people hate it,simplicity. It's a very barebones language (especially compared to modern ones), which makes it straightforward and allows you to focus more on the problem you're solving rather than the language itself. I'm looking at you, Rust.</p>
            <p class="social"><strong>Go</strong>: Once again, it’s all about simplicity. Go is about as good as a modern language can get,minimal syntax and a mature standard library with everything you need. It’s perfect for when I need to do something involving network programming.</p>
            <p class="social"><strong>Neovim</strong>: Surely you are seeing a trend by now—minimalism and simplicity :). I spend most of my time writing code, and I want it to be as efficient as possible. Neovim makes this possible due to its Vim bindings, but also due to its minimal and simple nature. It doesn't have a thousand buttons to click that can do everything under the sun—just a program that edits text well and can be extended to do exactly what you like.</p>
            <p class="social"><strong>NixOS</strong>: Nix fixed a lot of issues I previously had with my development environment. It allows me to declaratively build my OS, so I don’t have to worry about many intricacies related to package managers and the like. It's also pretty minimal which allows me to install only the programs I need and not everything under the sun like other operating systems.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p class=><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/chachacollins/cake">[cake]</a></strong>: It's a build system I wrote because I was somewhere with no internet connection and needed a build system. It's actually pretty cool and has alot of the same features as make but more minimal and with better syntax.</p>
            <p class="social"><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/chachacollins/chroma">[chroma]</a></strong>: It's a cli tool which generates documentation from your codebase. It uses mistralai to understand the codebase and generate suitable documentation for it saving developer time and effort.</p>
            <p class="social"><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/chachacollins/codex">[codex]</a></strong>: This is a literate programming preprocessor. It only works with markdown which allows it to easily parse it and extract revelant code blocks allowing for literate programming in markdown files which is awesome.</p>
